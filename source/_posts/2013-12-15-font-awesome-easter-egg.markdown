[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is a gorgeous icon font designed to play nicely with Bootstrap.  I was playing around with it today and noticed the highly detailed [fa-barcode](http://fontawesome.io/icon/barcode/) character:

<i class="fa fa-barcode"></i>

If we make it a little larger, we can see that it really looks like a legit barcode:

<i class="fa fa-barcode fa-5x"></i>

I scanned it with a barcode reader and it's the code for `FA`.

<i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> Font Awesome wins at detail.
