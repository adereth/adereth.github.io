This is my attempt at doing a bit more public creating.  I'm particularly interested in technical communication and so far this blog is primarily focused on exercising my skills.

I work at [Two Sigma Investments](http://www.twosigma.com/) on a variety of projects that let me practice the computer science and math that I love.
