One of the comments on the [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/f8nzc/programmatic_programming_font_comparison_101_vs/) of my first post suggested looking at groups of characters that might be troublesome:
```
1l|i!
`',;:.
oO0Q
(){}[]
5S
```
As a quick test, I wrote something to compare every pair of characters in a list:
