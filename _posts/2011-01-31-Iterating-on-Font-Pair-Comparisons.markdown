The previous post generated some great suggestions in the [Hacker News discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2147834).  I've incorporated some of the feedback and here’s a summary of the changes:

- Changed the colors to improve contrast
- Fixed the issue with the operator symbols (Thanks MMA_Pope!)
- Increased the size of the characters and reduced the horizontal spacing
- Added additional fonts

Here’s the current list of fonts included in the comparison:

If you’re interested in seeing the results for every pair, you can [download them all](https://s3.amazonaws.com/1overBlog/programming_fonts/AllFontComparisonsV2.zip).

The updated Mathematica code is available for [download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/1overBlog/programming_fonts/PairCompareV2.nb).

I’m open to suggestions for future investigations… thanks!
