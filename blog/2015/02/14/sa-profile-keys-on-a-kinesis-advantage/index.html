<p>I've been (slowly) working on building my own dream keyboard, but in the meantime I make the occasional ridiculous tweak to my Kinesis.  This weekend I got 3 lbs. of reject keys from <a href="http://www.keycapsdirect.com/">Signature Plastics</a> and I was fortunate enough to get enough keycaps to try something that I've been wanting to test for a while.</p>
<h2>Kinesis Advantage with DSA keycaps</h2>
<p>Almost a year ago, I saw <a href="http://sitr.us/">Jesse Hallett</a>'s excellent post detailing his <a href="http://sitr.us/2014/05/19/kinesis-advantage-with-dsa-keycaps.html">Kinesis Advantage with DSA keycaps</a>.  His results were impressive:</p>
<p><a href="http://sitr.us/2014/05/19/kinesis-advantage-with-dsa-keycaps.html"><img alt="Kinesis Advantage with DSA Keycaps" src="/images/kinesis-dsa.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://sitr.us/2014/05/19/kinesis-advantage-with-dsa-keycaps.html">Lesse Hallett's Blog</a></em></p>
<p>DSA keycaps are low and uniform, with spherical tops:</p>
<p><img alt="DSA Keycap Profile" src="/images/dsa.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php">Signature Plastics</a></em></p>
<p>They are particularly well suited for non-standard keyboard layouts, like the ErgoDox or Kinesis Advantage, because most other keycaps have variable heights and angles that were designed for traditional staggered layouts on a plane.</p>
<h2>SA keycaps</h2>
<p>Personally, I'm a big fan of the SA profile:</p>
<p><img alt="SA Keycap Profile" src="/images/sa.jpg" /></p>
<p>They're super tall and are usually manufactured with thick ABS plastic and given a smooth, high-gloss finish.  I'm a bit of a retro-fetishist and these hit all the right spots.  It's no surprise that projects and group buys that use SA profile often have a retro theme:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://deskthority.net/group-buys-f50/doubleshot-replacements-round-5-honey-sphericals-t6732.html">HONEY</a>, seeking to recreate a <a href="http://deskthority.net/resources/image/8881">classic Honeywell keyboard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pimpmykeyboard.com/deals/symbiosis/">Symbiosis</a>, seeking to recreate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard">Symbolics Space-cadet keyboard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pimpmykeyboard.com/deals/1976/">1976</a>, inspired by the colors of the 70's</li>
</ul>
<p>For this project I decided to go with all Row 3 profile SA keys in the two main key wells.  Row 3 is the home row on traditional layouts and the keycaps are completely symmetric, just like the DSA profile keys.  I was concerned about two main things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The curvature of the key well combined with the height might mean that the keys hit each other towards the top.</li>
<li>Jesse ran into one spot in the corner of the keywell closest to the thumb clusters where the keycap hit the plastic.  This would almost certainly be a problem with the much larger SA keys.</li>
</ol>
<p>The easiest way to find out was to pop off all the keycaps:</p>
<p><img alt="Kinesis Advantage with Keycaps Removed" src="/images/kinesis-bare.jpg" /></p>
<p>...and to see what fit:</p>
<p><img alt="Kinesis Advantage with Keycaps Removed" src="/images/kinesis-before-surgery.JPG" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, the height was not an issue.  The angles are all perfect and the top of the keys form a relatively tight surface.  The smaller gaps between the tops combined with the extreme smoothness of the SA keycaps results in a nice effect where I'm able to just glide my fingers across them without having to lift, similar to the feel of the modern Apple keyboards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 3 keys at the bottom of each keywell wouldn't fit.  I busted out the Dremel and carved out a little from the bottom, making room for those beautiful fat caps:</p>

<p><img alt="Kinesis Advantage with Keycaps Removed" src="/images/kinesis-hacked2.jpg" /></p>
<p>I used Row 1 keycaps for the 1x keys in the thumb clusters.  The extra height makes them not quite as difficult to reach:</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out:</p>
<p><img alt="Kinesis Advantage with Keycaps Removed" src="/images/kinesis-final.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's a pleasure to type on and I'm convinced that SA profile keys are going to be what I use when I eventually reach my final form.</p>
<p>If you're interested in doing this yourself, you should know that it'll be difficult to source the 1.25x keys that are used on the sides of the Kinesis Advantage.  A lot of the keysets that are being sold for split layouts are targeting the Ergodox, which uses 1.5x keys on the side.  It does look like the <a href="http://www.pimpmykeyboard.com/deals/symbiosis/">Symbiosis group buy</a> includes enough 1.25x's in the main deal, but you'd need to also buy the price Ergodox kit just to get those 4 2x's.  If you don't mind waiting an indefinite length of time, the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Round_5a">Round 5a group buy on Deskthority</a> is probably your best bet for getting exactly what you want.</p>
