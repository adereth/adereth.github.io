        <h1>Finishing up the ErgoDox</h1>
        <p>I've been busy with a few other keyboard projects since <a href="/blog/2014/02/12/building-an-ergodox/">my last post on my ErgoDox build</a>.  While working on those projects, I've gotten some parts and done a few more tweaks to the ErgoDox that I'd like to share.</p>
<h2>PBT DSA Keycaps</h2>
<p>The biggest improvement was switching the keycaps.  Originally I had used keycaps from <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/">WASD Keyboards</a> that were designed to be used with a normal keyboard.  Typical keyboards use keycaps that are very similar to DCS profile caps, which have different profiles for different rows:</p>
<p><img alt="DCS Keycap Profile" src="/images/dcs.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Source: <a href="http://keycapsdirect.com/key-caps.php">Signature Plastics</a></em></p>
<p>In contrast, DSA keycaps have concave spherical tops and are uniform in profile:</p>
<p><img alt="DSA Keycap Profile" src="/images/dsa.jpg" /></p>
<p>I had ordered a set of DSA keycaps from Signature Plastics for another project and decided to try them out on the ErgoDox:</p>
<p><img alt="Full keyboard" src="/images/full-ergo-green.jpeg" /></p>
<p>I was surprised with how much better these felt, particularly on the thumb cluster.  I now realize that a lot of my discomfort reaching the upper keys on the the thumb cluster came from their relatively high profile.</p>
<p>The DSA keycaps are also made out of PBT plastic instead of ABS.  They have a nice textured feel and the plastic is supposed to be much more robust.  As I said in my last post, <a href="http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/product/dsa-pbt-blank-sets">Pimp My Keyboard shop has PBT DCA blank sets for the ErgoDox</a> for $43, which is a great deal and is definitely the way to go if you're sourcing your own parts.</p>
<h2>TRRS Connector</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.digikey.com/">DigiKey</a> finally got the <a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/SJ-43514/CP-43514-ND/368146">TRRS connectors</a> in stock and sent them to me.  I was concerned that they wouldn't fit in my lower profile case, but a little Dremel action made it work:</p>
<p><img alt="TRRS Connector" src="/images/TRRS.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The keyboard didn't work after I added the connector.  It worked fine if I just had the right side plugged in, but as soon as I connected the left side, neither worked.  I took the whole thing apart and used an ohmmeter to test the 4 connections between the two halves.  It turned out that all of the connections were there, but there was a little resistance on one of them.  I resoldered it more thoroughly and everything worked fine.</p>
<h2>Sanding</h2>
<p>Finally, I did a little experimentation with wet sanding the sides to remove some of the burn marks from the paper during the laser cutting and to give a more even finish.  I used 400 grit sandpaper and made a little progress:</p>
<p><img alt="corner" src="/images/corner-zoom.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Acrylic dust is nasty stuff!  It didn't make as much of a difference as I hoped.  I'm going to do a little more experimentation sanding with acetone to see if I can melt it smoothly and make the 5 layers of acrylic look like one piece.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>My next project is going to involve a lot of acrylic bending, so I'm probably going to also take a stab at cutting and bending a stand for the ErgoDox that tents it at a better angle.  Any suggestions are appreciated!</p>
